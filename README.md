# Virtual-Wallet

In order to practice Angular and to improve my technical skills, I have enrolled in a course where I created this small angular application.

It is an Angular Application that helps the user to maintain its cryptocurrency virtual wallet.

The dates were taken from the public API exposed by https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation?.
